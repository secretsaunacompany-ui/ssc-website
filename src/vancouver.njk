<h2>Finnish Saunas for Vancouver</h2>
<p>Vancouver's wellness scene has caught up with what the Finns have known for centuries. Sauna isn't a trend here anymore -- it's infrastructure. From Kitsilano backyards to East Van laneways to commercial wellness spaces downtown, the demand is real.</p>
<p>We build in Squamish and deliver to Vancouver. That means you get workshop-built quality (not a field-assembled kit) without the markup of a city-based operation. Every sauna is constructed from Western Red Cedar, designed for your specific space, and installed by our team.</p>
<p>Smaller lot? Tight access? We build models from the compact S2 (fits a 6x8 footprint) up to commercial-grade SC units for gyms and spas.</p>
{% endset %}

<h2>Vancouver Service Area</h2>
<p>We deliver and install across Greater Vancouver including Kitsilano, Mount Pleasant, East Vancouver, Dunbar, Kerrisdale, Point Grey, and surrounding areas. For commercial operators, we also serve Burnaby, Richmond, and New Westminster.</p>
