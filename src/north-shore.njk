<h2>Built for North Shore Properties</h2>
<p>The North Shore has the kind of properties that suit a sauna perfectly -- larger lots, mountain backdrops, and homeowners who actually use their outdoor spaces. Whether it's a Deep Cove waterfront, a Lynn Valley hillside, or a West Van estate, we design builds that fit the site.</p>
<p>We're based in Squamish. Close enough for site visits, far enough that we're not paying Vancouver shop rates. That keeps your quote reasonable.</p>
<p>Our saunas are built with Western Red Cedar and designed to handle the North Shore's rain and humidity. Proper ventilation, drainage, and wood treatment are standard, not upgrades.</p>
{% endset %}
