<h2>The Whole Corridor, One Builder</h2>
<p>The Sea-to-Sky is our backyard. Our workshop is in Squamish, which puts us right in the middle of the corridor. We deliver anywhere from Lions Bay up through Whistler and Pemberton, and we've gone as far as Williams Lake when the project called for it.</p>
<p>This stretch of BC has some of the best sauna conditions anywhere -- cold lakes, mountain air, and communities that actually spend time outdoors. Our mobile saunas are built for exactly this, whether it's for lakeside sessions, event rentals, or properties without permanent foundations.</p>
<p>We also build permanent residential and commercial installations. Every build is constructed at our Squamish workshop and delivered directly to your site.</p>

<h2>Sea-to-Sky Communities We Serve</h2>
<p>Lions Bay, Furry Creek, Britannia Beach, Squamish, Brackendale, Paradise Valley, Whistler, Pemberton, and D'Arcy. Whether you need a backyard sauna for your cabin or a mobile unit for your rental business, we build it all from our Squamish workshop.</p>
