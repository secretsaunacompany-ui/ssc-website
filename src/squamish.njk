<h2>Our Home Base</h2>
<p>Secret Sauna Company is based in Squamish. Our workshop is on Progress Way, which means your sauna is built minutes from where it'll be installed. No freight costs, no shipping damage, no waiting on a truck from across the country.</p>
<p>We know the climate here. The rain, the cold snaps, the way moisture works against untreated wood. Every build accounts for Squamish conditions, from drainage design to ventilation and material selection.</p>
<p>Whether you're putting a sauna in your backyard in Valleycliffe, on a property in Brackendale, or at a commercial site downtown, we'll walk the space with you before we cut a single board.</p>

<h2>Saunas We've Built in Squamish</h2>
<p>From residential backyard builds to commercial installations, Squamish is where most of our work happens. Our standard models (S2 through S8) and commercial SC builds are all constructed at our Progress Way workshop.</p>
<p>If you're in the Squamish area and want to see our work firsthand, <a href="/contact/" class="link--accent-underline">get in touch</a> and we'll set up a shop visit.</p>
