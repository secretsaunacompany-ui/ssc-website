                <h3 class="faq-question">What type of foundation is needed?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Most of our residential saunas are built with open deck flooring for natural ventilation and drainage. Ideally the sauna is placed on packed gravel, concrete feet, or pavers—allowing airflow beneath while ensuring water from inside has a place to drain.</p>
