            <h2 class="fade-in">Design approach</h2>
            <p class="fade-in">Every sauna begins with questions: How will you use it? Who will gather there? What does the space need to feel right?</p>
            <p class="fade-in">We listen first, then design—creating saunas that fit naturally into their surroundings and serve their intended purpose with quiet confidence.</p>
            <p class="fade-in">Before production begins, we create detailed 3D renderings of your sauna so you can see exactly what your finished project will look like. This allows us to refine every detail together—from bench placement to window positioning—ensuring the final build matches your vision perfectly.</p>

                    <h3>Materials & construction</h3>
                    <p>We build with Western Red Cedar, locally sourced when possible. Cedar's natural resistance to moisture and decay makes it ideal for sauna construction, while its warmth and aroma create the right atmosphere. For enhanced durability, we offer Thermowood—heat-treated timber that's exceptionally stable and rot-resistant.</p>
                    <p>Exteriors can be customized to suit your style and setting, from traditional cedar siding to modern metal cladding. Our joinery is simple and strong. Hardware is stainless or galvanized. Insulation is proper. Stoves are reliable. Everything is built to last decades, not years.</p>

                    <h3>Performance & durability</h3>
                    <p>A good sauna heats evenly, retains warmth efficiently, and creates proper löyly—that soft steam that makes Finnish sauna what it is.</p>
                    <p>We design for performance first: airflow, heat retention, moisture management, and user comfort. Our superior insulation and construction means your sauna requires less fuel to heat and maintain temperature—efficiency that pays for itself over time. Our saunas work reliably in Canadian winters and through years of heavy use.</p>
