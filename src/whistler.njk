<h2>Sauna Culture Meets Mountain Living</h2>
<p>Whistler has a natural affinity for sauna. Cold plunges after skiing, evening sessions with mountain views, recovery after a day on the trails. It's not a luxury here -- it's part of how people live.</p>
<p>We build saunas for Whistler properties that handle the full alpine range: heavy snowfall, sub-zero nights, and the kind of UV exposure you get at elevation. Western Red Cedar, proper insulation, and ventilation designed for the conditions.</p>
<p>For resorts, lodges, and commercial operators, our SC model is purpose-built for high-traffic use. We handle everything from site assessment to installation.</p>
{% endset %}

{% set local_content %}
<h2>Whistler Installations</h2>
<p>From private chalets in Kadenwood to rental properties in Creekside, we've built saunas across the Whistler area. The resort market here has its own requirements -- guest-proof construction, commercial-grade heaters, and finishes that can take daily use.</p>
<p>If you're a property owner or operator in Whistler, <a href="/contact/" class="link--accent-underline">reach out for a quote</a>. We'll come up and assess your site.</p>
