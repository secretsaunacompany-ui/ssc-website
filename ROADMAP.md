# SSC Website — Roadmap

Ideas parked for later. Order is not a priority ranking.

## AI Advisor Widget (parked, needs more thought)

**What it is.** A chat widget that lives on contact, about, faq, saunas, and warranty pages. Context-aware starters per page (product, care, commercial, etc.), multi-turn on some pages, single-shot on others.

**Current state.** Code is in the repo but gated off via `site.features.advisor = false` in `src/_data/site.json`. Backend is `netlify/functions/advisor.js`. Frontend is `js/advisor.js`. Containers are already wired into the relevant templates — just wrapped in `{% if site.features.advisor %}`.

**Why it's off.** The backend wasn't fully wired and the widget wasn't functioning in production. Good idea, shipped too early.

**What it would need before re-enabling:**
- Backend function verified end-to-end against current Anthropic SDK
- Prompts reviewed per page type; right now they're generic and duplicate work the page copy already does
- UX decision: is a chat widget even the right surface? The contact page already has a structured form. A chat widget on top risks split-brain UX (which one do I fill in?). Consider:
  - Advisor on product/FAQ pages only (where questions are open-ended)
  - Advisor ONLY as a fallback when a form field is blank and user stalls
  - Or skip the widget entirely and use the saved prompts to improve static FAQ content
- Analytics to verify it actually drives inquiries rather than replacing them with conversations that never convert
- Rate limiting + abuse handling on the function

**Re-enabling:** flip `features.advisor` to `true` in `src/_data/site.json`. All existing templates will render their containers again and the script tag loads.
